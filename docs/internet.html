    <h2>Internet Search - The True Story of the Internet</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-10">
                <img src="images/search.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Internet Search">

                <p>The roots for search can be traced back to Stanford University. Jerry Yang and David Filo, better known as being the
                    cofounders of Yahoo, knew something needed to be done to make searching the Internet easier. They knew it needed
                    some sort of user-friendly directory that made finding what you were looking for as easy as clicking a button- so
                    that’s exactly what they did.</p>
                <p>“Jerry and David’s Guide to the World Wide Web” is what they called the solution to this problem. But even with a
                    name like this, it spread across the country- achieving millions of downloads in just a short period of time. With
                    how popular their search tool was becoming, they thought it needed to be renamed. They wanted it to be catchy but
                    not overly complicated; and that’s how Yahoo was born. </p>
                <p>Like a lot of other Internet companies at the time, Yahoo’s biggest challenge was making money. They were essentially
                    providing a free service to millions of people with no way to make money off of it. Michael Moritz, a venture
                    capitalist, paid visit to Yahoo. He had the idea of putting advertisements on the web, something at the time that
                    had never been done before. Yang and Filo were not a fan of this idea but what choice did they have? They needed a
                    way to make cash. So, in ate 1995, Yahoo began taking banner ads. This was not only a huge milestone for Yahoo but
                    for the rest of the world, showing that you could make money on the web. </p>
                <p>In 1996, Yahoo began facing many challengers, but one in particular kept Yahoo on high alert. That company’s name was
                    Excite and their tech was much more sophisticated than Yahoo’s. Unlike Yahoo, Excite was powered solely by software.
                    It was able to find relevant web pages based on what you were searching, rather than just displaying a list of
                    websites you might want to look at. This was the basic version of what we know as search today.</p>
                <p>By 1997, the Internet was flooded with people. Everyone was taking advantage of the power of search. But soon enough,
                    issues arose. Now with the addition of ads on the web, companies were too focused on finding new ways to make money
                    and not provided people with relevant content when they were trying to find something. There was just too much
                    flash.</p>
                <p>Larry Paige and Sergei Brin were two other Stanford students with an idea on how to make search, once again, useful.
                    Paige had the idea that the Internet was running a popularity contest on its own sites. How many times a site is
                    linked to another was a “vote” to how popular it was. The more times a site is linked, the more relevant people
                    found it. Link counting is what made them so successful. So successful that you might have heard of their company,
                    Google.</p>
                <p>Now what would a tech startup be without the help of a venture capitalist? Vinod Khosla introduced Google to Excite,
                    he was hoping that Excite would purchase Google; and they easily could have for about a million dollars. But Google
                    went a different route.</p>
                <p>After receiving about 12 million dollars in funding from a range of investors, they needed to figure out a way to
                    make money on their own. For they were losing about half a million a month. They were hesitant to the idea of using
                    ads because they wanted their site to be user friendly. But with a little “help” from Bill Gross at IdeaLab, Google
                    was about to take off.</p>
                <p>Gross had the idea that whenever someone made a search, they were telling you a little bit about what they were
                    interested in. He thought that these “keywords” could be worth a fortune to advertisers. Google and Gross had
                    several meetings to talk about a potential partnership, but ultimately, nothing came from it. </p>
                <p>That was until, several months later, Google made a similar service called AdWords. Gross sued Google over this
                    similarity but the two ended up settling, leaving Gross with a nice amount of stock.</p>
                <p>As time went on, Google continued to tweak AdWords- separating ads from search results to give users a better
                    experience. As the service got better, Google rained in more and more money, marking the start of the Internet
                    economy. </p>
