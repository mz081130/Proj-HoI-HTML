<h1>The Invention of the Internet</h1>
<p>The creation of the Internet starts in the 1950’s with psychologist and professor JCR Licklider. Licklider was a
    professor at MIT whose vision was that computers would allow us to communicate better and share ideas. At the time,
    computers were something you would see in science fiction movies. Some even thought that flying saucers and ray guns
    were more plausible than the creation of something that could bring computers together.</p>
<p>Computers were not designed to communicate. The first computers were the size of a room and you were lucky to find
    one in a city. </p>
<p>In the late 1950’s, there was a shift away from the need of computers to communicate to getting a man on the moon.
    This came after America saw the need to beat Russia in getting there. The Advanced Research Project Agency, ARPA,
    was in charge of the space program. However, it was soon replaced by NASA.</p>
<p>Not long after, an MIT graduate student named Leonard Kleinrock began to bring light to Licklider’s vision- that
    communication between multiple computers could very well be a reality. </p>
<p>It wasn’t until the 1960’s, the traditional telephone circuit was seen as an issue. The telephone used a technology
    called circuit switching, in which a connection was made between two phones to allow a call to be made. Even if no
    one was speaking on the line, the connection still existed. A major flaw with this system was that if the connection
    was broken, a call could not be made or was disconnected. This became a matter of national security. An indestructible
    telecommunication network needed to be created.</p>
<p>Paul Baran was hired to solve this problem. He came up with the idea of a “fishnet network” in which if a connection
    was ever lost, there would already be another existing connection ready to take its place. The only problem was,
    this was just an idea and he did not know how to implement such a network. He later came up with the idea of “hot
    potato routing” inspired by mice in a maze. The maze could be seen as a network, and the mice inside could be seen
    as packets of information trying to find their way through, trying to get to their next/final destination. With this
    idea, Baran had successfully come up with a model of a packet switching network. And in 1962, there was enough proof
    that a reliable internet network could be created. It would just have to wait 7 years to be implemented. </p>
<p>In 1966, ARPA scientist Bob Taylor had a problem. He needed separate terminals to sign into different time-shared
    computers. Time-sharing was a technology in which a user would sit a terminal, type in a question and inquiry and
    get an immediate response. At this time, computers were still unable to talk to each other and he would have to move
    from terminal to terminal to get his work done. But he thought that one terminal could be suffice if they were all
    on a common network. Thus, came the idea of resource sharing.</p>
<p>Taylor was given one million dollars to make a computer network a reality. He recruited Larry Roberts for the job.
    Robert’s build the first experimental connection between two computers at MIT. He had learned about packet switching
    from Kleinrock. Robert’s soon came up with the idea to build minicomputers to form a network. Each of those
    minicomputers would be tied to a time-shared computer. With that, each only had to learn how to work with the
    standard minicomputer. </p>
<p>The first minicomputers became known as Interface Message Processors or IMP’s. Robert’s plan was to network 4
    identical IMP’s each tied to a different computer. With this being nothing more than a trial, no one wanted to bid
    on the project. That was until a team from BBN headed by Frank Heart came into the picture. And by the end of 1969,
    all four computers were connected. </p>
<p>But now what? There was not much to do on the ARPA net other than transfer data files. That was until the first
    killer app came about- email.</p>
<p>Invented by Raymond Tomlinson, email started out as nothing more than a project he was doing on his own time. Its
    original purpose was to have a single computer send messages to someone else on the same time-shared computer. He
    then thought about the idea of being able to send files between multiple computers on a network. Without him, email
    (and the iconic @ sign to signify a user being “at” a computer), might not be what it is today.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 1972, ARPA net still had less than 25 sites online. Its team members were hopeful that would change
    with their upcoming International Conference on Computers and Communications. This would be the coming out party for
    networks, a way for people to get interested in the Internet. Bob Metcalfe was put in charge of putting together a
    list of what computers today, and he was able to find 19 different things. At the time, this was an incredible
    amount. Something that was once only perceived as science fiction now had the ability to do 19 different things.
    But it was time to put the network to the test.</p>
<p>Executives from AT&T were at that conference and they wanted to see what all the hype was about. Metcalfe would be
    the one to give a live demo of what the network could do. He fired up the computer, eager and ready to go. But then,
    it crashed. This may have turned off AT&T to the idea of networking, but not to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The development of networks took off after the conference. In 1973, Bet Surf and Bob Khan established a set of rules
    known as the TCP/IP protocol that would allow different computer networks to pass packets back and forth. The
    protocol would allow different networks to interconnect using a technology called Gateways. All of this put together
    solve the issue of the need to create a single internet; and by 1983, TCP/IP was a universal standard.</p>
<p>In June of 1992, Congress based a bill that took the Internet into the public, which President bush then signed into
    law. However, the Internet was not user friendly at this point. You had to be a computer nerd to understand how to
    use it. But that all changed thanks to Tim Burners Lee, a physicist at the CERN Research Institute of Switzerland.
    He developed a software that allowed users to more easily follow threads of information. This became known as the
    World Wide Web. </p>
