                <p>Communication and the way we connect with one another is changing. Big company used to control the content you would
                    see, how you see it, and how much you have to pay for it. This is all happening in thanks to the web.</p>
                <p>The TV industry was nearly impossible to get into for the average person. Big companies were in control of who and
                    what would be on the air. That all changed with the creation of YouTube, giving anyone access to post what they, for
                    a lack of better words, felt like posting. They gave people the power to “broadcast yourself.” But what made this
                    even more important was the reach it had. There was the potential to reach millions all with content that was
                    created at home. </p>
                <p>Digg, founded by Kevin Rose, was another company that invested in giving power to people. It was a news company that
                    focused on important stories but in a different way. Rather than someone from the company deciding what would be on
                    the front page, it was decided by its user. The more people that “digged” on a story, the more prominent it became
                    on the site. As Jay Adelson, CEO of Digg said, “what Digg is doing is saying a blog could be on the same plane as
                    the New York Times and it’s up to the people to decide what’s important.”</p>
                <p>The ideology behind giving power to the people that YouTube and Digg believed in was known as the wisdom of crowds.
                    They knew that people, more than anything, loved the sound of their own voices. But it was Mark Zuckerberg, founder
                    of Facebook, that understood this better than anyone else at this time. </p>
                <p>But before we can understand how all of these big companies like Facebook, Digg, and YouTube came to be, we have to
                    start with how idea of communicating and sharing through the web first began. </p>
                <p>It starts with college students David Weekley, Justin Frankel, Cabel Sasser and Steve Frank putting together music on
                    PC’s and the web. With the creation of MP3, it was easier than ever to move music around the net in an easy to
                    understand way. The friends created media players known as Audion and Winamp. These apps allowed music lovers to
                    store and listen to music right from their computers. </p>
                <p>This started to become an issue in the music industry. Profits were made from people going out and buying records,
                    not from MP3’s being downloaded and shared on the web. The record industry was not a fan of this, but people didn’t
                    care. They wanted free and easy to access music; they didn’t care about the rules of the industry. </p>
                <p>Things were about to get even worse thanks to an 18-year-old named Shawn Fanning. Fanning was the creator of Napster.
                    The idea came from his college roommate spending so much time searching the web to find good, downloadable music- he
                    thought there could be an easier way. He understood that there were people all over the place with existing music
                    libraries and people who would be interested in that music. All there needed to be was a way for people to share
                    music, thus came Napster. </p>
                <p>Napster allowed you to search for songs you were interested in and download them right from someone’s hard drive to
                    your own. Fanning started out by giving Napster to 12 people to try out and he asked that they don’t share it with
                    anyone else. But within a week, it had been downloaded 10,000 times. Within four months, it had passed a million
                    downloads. He was not only giving people a way to share music, but he was unintentionally creating one of the first
                    web communities. </p>
                <p>Although this new app was loved by many, it was about to create one of the biggest controversies of all time. It had
                    caught the eye of Hilary Rosen, head of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). This company was
                    created to protect the music business from exactly what Fanning had created. She contacted Napster, once it had
                    taken off to Silicon Valley, asking if they knew what they were doing was illegal. The only way they could fix what
                    they had done was by removing all copyrighted music. Which you could imagine, was a majority of what was on the
                    site. </p>
                <p>Big names in the music industry were not happy with what Fanning had created. They worked so hard to create music for
                    people to love and buy, and Napster was taking away what they should have been earning. Metallica probably being
                    the biggest artist saying how frustrated they were with what was going on. But all this did was make Napster even
                    more popular and expanded its user base. </p>
                <p>Soon enough, Rosen and the RIAA filed a lawsuit against Napster. In July of 2001, the decision was made that Napster
                    needed to be shut down. </p>
                <p>Looking back at YouTube, Viacom saw striking similarities with what Napster had done. Viacom thought YouTube needed
                    to be stopped since its users were uploading copyrighted videos. However, unlike Napster, YouTube was not and
                    underfunded startup. It was funded by Google, which acquired the company in 2006. Chad Hurley, co-founder of
                    YouTube, knew that big TV companies were not so much threaten by the copyrighted content being posted but that
                    people would rather watch themselves over what companies like Viacom had to offer. YouTube was just one of the many
                    companies that allowed people to take part in the two-way web. This marked a new era where content was created by
                    users, an era known as Web 2.0./p>
                <p>In the wake of the dot com crash, all the pieces of Web 2.0 came together with social networking. The first major
                    social networking site to stick out was MySpcae. MySpace allowed its users to create pages to express who they were.
                    It was meant to almost resemble their bedroom. You could pick from different colors, upload pictures, share and play
                    your favorite song. It was so popular that by 2005, it had over 27 million users. </p>
                <p>In the Internet world, there is always something new not too far away. And in the age of social networking, the next
                    new thing was Facebook. Starting off as a way for students at Harvard to connect, Zuckerberg never knew how big
                    Facebook could one day be. That was until, students from other schools started asking for Facebook to come to their
                    campuses. It then quickly spread to all college campuses in the US, to high schools, to companies, to anyone who
                    wanted an account could sign up. It was growing at a rate where the user base would double every six months. </p>
                <p>It was now a head to head battle of Facebook against MySpace. At the time this video was released, MySpace still had
                    a larger user base than Facebook. They were doing everything they could to stay ahead of their new rival, but as we
                    can see in today’s world, Facebook ultimately got the best of them.</p>
