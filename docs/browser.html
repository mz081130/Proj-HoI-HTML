<h1>Broswer Wars</h1>
<p>After Tim Berners Lee came up with the World Wide Web in 1989, the issue of the Internet not being user friendly
    still persisted. There were just a handful of webpages and they were just lines of text. You needed to be a computer
    nerd to understand how to browse the web.</p>
<p>Mark Andreessen had a different thought of how the Internet could be used. He envisioned that, one day, everyone
    would use the web. And not only use the web but use it in their everyday lives. So, he designed Mosaic. </p>
<p>Mosaic made surfing the web easy, and it was free. It was a point and click software that also enabled the web to be
    filled with images, audio, and (easy to understand) text. He initially sent out a beta of Mosaic to 12 people, but
    it didn’t stop there. It spread like wildfire and before he knew it, a million people were using this pre-released
    software. Now he just needed a way to make money off of it.</p>
<p>Jim Clark, a professor at Stanford, ended up investing a third of his net worth on the project. He, even before
    betting on this, had thoughts about the convergence of different kinds of media with digital technology. To take
    Mosaic to the next level, he needed to assemble a team- so he and Andreessen went to Illinois.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that during this time, Microsoft was king of the tech world. Well, Bill Gates to be more
    specific. Gates was a Harvard drop out at age 19. He had dropped out to start Microsoft with his friend Paul Allen.
    The two of them dreamed of a world where everyone had a PC running Microsoft software and by 1993, 90% of the world
    was. Gates had doubts about the web and didn’t think too much of it. That was until Netscape came into the picture.</p>
<p>Netscape, the company that arose from the idea of Mosaic, was the result of Clark and Andreessen’s trip to Illinois.
    The web was becoming more and more popular every day and Netscape wanted to go live sooner rather than later. Some
    Microsoft employees knew about Netscape and wanted to find out more. Some even went as far as calling Netscape,
    making it known it was Microsoft calling. Netscape declined. </p>
<p>Navigator, formally known as Mosaic, began being sold in October of 1994. When it quickly reached over a million
    downloads, Gates finally understood just how important the Internet would be. With the idea of computers only
    running Microsoft software, Gates was now ready to beat Netscape. And there was no time to waste. This marked the
    beginning of the Browser War. </p>
<p>By 1995, the Internet was everywhere. And Netscape knew it was only a matter of time before Microsoft tried to take
    what they had built. </p>
<p>Netscape hired Gary Rebeck, the best antitrust lawyer in Silicon Valley. Microsoft was trying anything and everything
    they could to stop others from downloading Navigator. The two finally sat down for a conversation, one which no one
    knows what really happened. But it led to Netscape filing an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft, in which they
    (Netscape) won. </p>
<p>After a year of existence, Clark wanted to take Netscape public. And when they did, the stock went through the roof.
    Clark had invested 5 million at open and made 663 million by close on the first day. With this Netscape began to
    think they were invincible, but after Andreessen made a comment about Microsoft to the press, their feud was about
    to get even worse. </p>
<p>Microsoft soon created Internet Explorer. They continued to release version after version trying to catch up to what
    Netscape had built. Everyone at Netscape was working like their lives depended on it because in reality, it did.
    Then, things took a turn for the worst with Internet Explorer 4- Microsoft was able to give it to its customers for
    free.</p>
<p>By 1997, the Browser War had come to an end. Netscape was soon acquired by AOL, the final nail in their coffin. </p>
