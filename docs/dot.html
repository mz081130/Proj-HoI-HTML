<h1>The Dot Com Bubble</h1>
<p>After companies like Google and Yahoo had found ways to make profit off the Internet, others were beginning to take
    advantage of this new age of the Internet economy. Two of the biggest companies to come from this time were Amazon
    and eBay.</p>
<p>Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, started off on Wall Street. He was a highly analytical man with the drive to make
    something great. He started coming up with a list of everything you could sell on the Internet, but what topped the
    list was books. There were millions of books to be sold and he understood that there could be an easier way to get
    those books in the hands of people all around the world. Bezos launched Amazon in the summer of 1995 and its growth
    hasn’t slowed down since./p>
<p>Around the same time, Pierre Omidyar, a software programmer, had a similar thought to Bezos. He saw the Internet as
    a place where people could come together and make a marketplace. After throwing together some simple, yet powerful
    code over a holiday weekend, eBay was born. When the site first went up, there was not much to choose from. There
    were some old tech parts and collectibles that look like they hadn’t been touched in years. But as the website’s
    popularity grew, more and more became available on the site. Omidyar was earning thousands and thousands of dollars
    just from fees people had to pay.</p>
<p>In the first 30 days of launching, Amazon was already shipping to 45 countries and all 50 US states. Bezos himself
    did not expect the company to grow so fast. He thought people would be hesitant to the idea of paying online. But
    even for someone so analytical, he miscalculated.</p>
<p>It only took 4 years for the Internet to reach 50 million users. This is in part to two very important laws. Moore’s
    Law, created by Gordon Moore, said that the speed and power of integrated circuits from microprocessors to memory
    chips doubles every 18 months. This rapid growth was needed for computers to become smaller and more portable.
    Engineers would also use the newest chips that had been created to continue making even new chips- the process was
    self-accelerating. The other law, Metcalfe’s Law, created by Robert Metcalfe, satiated that ever new node that’s
    added to the network doesn’t just increase the networks value by plus one, it’s a much steeper number. For example,
    if you have two computers, there is one connection between the two of them. Add another computer, and you jump from
    one connection to three. These laws were working hand in hand by the middle of the 1990s. The more people who were
    able to get their hands on the computer (thanks to the smaller chips), would use the “network” thus increasing its
    overall value. </p>
<p>With the increased popularity of the Internet and online shopping, the Amazon IPO took place in 1997. The company was
    only two years old at the time. Bezos had a get big fast mentality, doing anything possible to get as many users as
    they could. His biggest strategy was lowering book prices whenever he could. The biggest hurdle he needed to get
    over was figuring out how to get people who didn’t already trust purchasing online, to trust his company. Luckily,
    some mathematicians by the names of Whitfield Different, Martin Hellman and Ralph Merle, came up with a solution
    that any company in the e-commerce world could take advantage of.</p>
<p>The solution was something called public key cryptography. It was a way to prevent thieves from taking a customer’s
    credit card information when making a purchase. Customer were able to securely send credit card information to
    companies using a “lock box” that only the company was able to “open.” This ingenious idea was the steppingstone for
    the online shopping experience we all use today.</p>
<p>Looking back at eBay, Omidyar decided he needed an a-list business partner if he wanted Wall Street to ever take the
    company seriously. He on boarded Harvard MBA, Meg Whitman. She played a huge roll in defining what the company was
    and what it was going to be. When Omidyar first started eBay, he had done no prior research as to who a target
    demographic for the site might be. As it turned out, a lot of people had a lot to sell. As Whitman mention,
    there were a lot of Beanie Babies being sold on the site. </p>
<p>eBay was set to launch its public offering in late 1998. Even though many doubted the company’s success, its stocks
    soared. By the end of its first day, they were valued at more than $2 billion.</p>
<p>Amazon and eBay’s IPO’s left Bezos and Omidyar rich and famous. Their success had inspired others to try and copy
    what they had achieved. They had made it look so easy. Everyone was moving to Silicon Valley; new companies were
    popping up every day (most of them not serving a real purpose). </p>
<p>Henry Blodget, a venture capitalist, was an important player in Amazon’s success. He had predicated Amazon stock
    would land between $300 and $500 dollars within a year. This sparked a frenzy amongst investors. So much of a frenzy
    that it didn’t take Amazon a year, but only several weeks. Blodget began recommending companies that he knew would
    not succeed, just so he could make money from the investments. He turned the internet boom into a giant speculation.</p>
<p>With the continuous growth of the Internet, companies were trying to run thousands of miles of fiber optic cables in
    the ground. This was in part to the need of bandwidth that made the Internet possible. Fiber optic cables are made
    of glass or plastic, and the fiber is a thin as a strand of hair. Light travels through the fiber, sending millions
    of pulses every second. Light normally travels in a straight line, but the fiber is lined with a mirrored surface
    that keeps the light from escaping. The light pulses being sent can be compared to Morse code, except a much faster
    version. These light pulses are what make up the pictures, video and text on our screens. </p>
<p>Companies were spending millions of dollars on making websites they hoped people would use. But some only saw
    hundreds, if that, of dollars in sales. This led to the Nasdaq losing more than 2/3’s of its value. And people were
    blaming Blodget- since he was the one putting false hope in people’s minds. The crash ended in a three and a half
    trillion dollar lose within the span of a year. An incomprehensible amount of money. But for companies like Amazon
    and eBay, they were doing just fine.</p>
<p>These companies understood how to keep users engaged and coming back for more in ways the other guys would never
    think of. And it all revolved around the user experience. The web was more than just for selling stuff, but it was
    a way to give power to ordinary people.</p>
